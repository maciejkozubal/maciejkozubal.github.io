### Running Locally

To run the site locally:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Ruby and Bundler installed, then run:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```
2.  **Serve**: Start the Jekyll server (this cleans the cache first):
    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
    ```

### Customization

This site uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme. To override theme files (e.g., layouts, includes), copy the original file from the theme's directory into the same path in this project. You can find the theme's location by running `bundle info minimal-mistakes-jekyll`.
